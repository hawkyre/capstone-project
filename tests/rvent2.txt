The title is not that kind of cliche for starters. When I began dating my boyfriend it was nice, he loved me for me and we shared a lot of the same interests, but as we got closer I noticed how his clinginess was starting to get to me. I could not be away from him for more than 30 minuets before he got upset. whenever I wanted to spend my free periods by myself he would throw a fit, I'm not exaggerating btw, if I didn't want to sleep together on a call he would get pissed and spam me until I said yes. the problem finally pushed me off the edge when I told him my family and I were going out of town for a Christmas event, there was not enough room for him to go and it was family only per my parents rules. He kept pushing saying to leave my grandmother or brother behind so he could go or my family rent an SUV, we weren't going to do any of that because that is selfish, am I wrong? he got really angry and claimed 'we weren't even trying' that's when I had it, I broke things off with him and I felt happy because of it, this clingy attitude was making me feel shackled to him, but now he won't stop spamming me and calling ,me threating to unalive himself and now I'm starting to feel regret. If I went back I know I'd be miserable but I feel guilty and want to go back I'm not sure what to do anymore. If you read this far thank you, I needed to get this off my chest somewhere
