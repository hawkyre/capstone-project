This happened last week and my mom and sister are still upset. My wife gave birth a month ago. We usually do thanksgiving at my moms house but with the new baby we decided to do it at our house this year with mom and sister coming over early to cook.

Baby had a terrible night the night before thanksgiving. When my mom and sister came over to cook I warned them that baby and wife were finally sleeping so please be quiet. My sister repeatedly made noise and woke up baby multiple times I kept warning her. She said she wasn’t trying to make a lot of noise and was just cooking and was trying to be as quiet as she could.

By the third time my wife was in tears and so was baby my wife flipped and demanded I get everyone out of the house. I didn’t want to kick my mom out but since sister was the one making the noise I told her to just leave before my wife lost it more.

She argued with me but eventually left and my mom went with her they ended up going to a restaurant to eat. We ordered take out and a lot of the uncooked food went to waste.

Wife is still upset because she thinks they should have been more considerate of baby and baby’s first thanksgiving was ruined. Mom and sister are upset because they claim they were being quiet as they could and we kicked them out anyway.
